## Performance

### Model Performance

| Operation | Average Time | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Image Captioning** | 1-2 seconds | BLIP model processing |
| **Object Detection** | 0.5-1 seconds | DETR model inference |
| **Story Generation** | 2-3 seconds | GPT-2 text generation |
| **Total Analysis** | 3-6 seconds | Complete pipeline |

### System Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2+ cores
- **RAM**: 4GB+ (8GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB+ for models
- **Network**: Stable internet for model downloads

#### Recommended Requirements
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible (optional, faster processing)
- **Storage**: 5GB+ SSD

### Optimization Tips

- **Model Caching**: Models are cached after first use
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple images processed efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking API responses

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Model download failed"
**Solution**: Check internet connection and try again. Models are downloaded on first run.

#### "File must be an image"
**Solution**: Ensure uploaded file is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP).

#### "File size must be less than 10MB"
**Solution**: Compress the image or use a smaller file.

#### "Backend connection failed"
**Solution**: Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### "Frontend not loading"
**Solution**: Check that you're opening the correct HTML file and that the backend is running.

#### "Story generation failed"
**Solution**: This is usually a temporary issue. Try uploading the image again.

### Development Issues

#### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill process on port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or use different port
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

#### Python environment issues
```bash
# Recreate virtual environment
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow model loading
- Models are downloaded once and cached
- First run will be slower
- Subsequent runs are much faster

#### Memory usage
- Models use ~2GB RAM when loaded
- Consider closing other applications if needed
